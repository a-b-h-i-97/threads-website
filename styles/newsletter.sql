And the advice has worked out pretty well too. But would it be actually possible to solve a problem by making it harder than it originally is?                  Let’s find out!!                </p>                <p>                  Imagine (imagine!) that the Department of Computer Science has been allotted some new land as a part of expansion of the campus.                  Some of the land was decided to be used to honour an iconic figure in the field of computer science: Alan Turing.                  To do this, a big square courtyard would be constructed, divided into unit squares, at the centre of which a statue of Alan Turing would be placed in a single unit square.                   Recognizing the importance of the binary system, we insist that the dimensions of the square be a power of two.                </p>                <p>                  We hire a genius architect, Jed Mosley, to get the job done. As we all know, Jed (like most geniuses) is a little bit eccentric, and <i>he</i> insists that the tiles used for the courtyard be of a particular L-shape as such:                </p>                <div class="img"><img src="http://newsletter-cseanitc.rhcloud.com/uploads/photos/14.jpg"/></div>                <p>The next figure then represents a valid tiling:</p>                <div class="img"><img src="./images/articles/validtile.jpg"/></div>                <p>But now, we have problem. How exactly are we supposed to know that there’s going to be a valid tiling for any n that we choose? How do we know, that after the tiling, there would be a square left in the centre to place Turing’s statue? Is there a way out?</p>                <p>Challenge accepted. We need to prove that there’s a valid tiling leaving a square in the centre empty for any n that we choose. Well the only two proof techniques that we’re largely familiar with are proof by induction and proof by contradiction, and the latter doesn’t seem to be the guy for the job. Onward with induction then:</p>                <p><strong>Attempt #1:</strong></p>                <p>Let P(n) be the proposition that there exists a tiling of a 2<sup>n</sup> x 2<sup>n</sup> courtyard with a square remaining empty in the centre.</p>                <p><strong>Base case: </strong>P(0) is obviously true, since at n = 0, all we have is a 1 x 1 square and we can put Turing’s statue there.</p>                <p><strong>Inductive step:</strong>  Assume that  P(n) is true. We must prove that there is a way to tile a 2<sup>n+1</sup> x 2<sup>n+1</sup> courtyard with a square empty in the centre, i.e. that P(n + 1) is true.</p>                <p>We divide the 2<sup>n+1</sup> x 2<sup>n+1</sup> courtyard into four, and we get four squares of dimension 2<sup>n</sup> each. Each 2<sup>n</sup> x 2<sup>n</sup> square has a square at its centre empty, by the induction hypothesis.</p>                <p>Uh oh...trouble!! We can’t bring together the four empty squares in the centre of the four “quadrants” to form a tiling with one empty square!! In other words, we can’t prove this hypothesis!! Ah...nostalgia from that last discrete math exam ;-)</p>                <p>Well we''re not giving up yet, let’s chuck the old hypothesis and start with a new one:</p>              </div>              <div class="col-md-6">                <p><strong>Attack #2:</strong></p>                <p><strong>Proof:</strong> Let P(n) be the proposition that there exists a tiling of a 2<sup>n</sup> x 2<sup>n</sup> courtyard with a square remaining empty <i>ANYWHERE</i> we want.</p>                <p>At this point, you’re probably saying: “Wait – what!? Life is already difficult enough as it is trying to prove the hypothesis for a SINGLE square and now you want to try to prove the hypothesis for ALL the squares? Are you out of your mind!?”</p>                <p>Relax. This is a standard technique in induction: if you can’t prove an inductive hypothesis, try to prove a - wait for it - grander one. How does that help us? Allow me to demonstrate:</p>                <p><strong>Base case:</strong> P(0) is true as earlier – because there’s only one square, we can just put the statue there.</p>                <p><strong>Inductive step:</strong> Assume that P(n) is true.</p>                <p>Now to prove that P(n + 1) is true:</p>                <p>As earlier we split up the 2<sup>n + 1</sup> x 2<sup>n + 1</sup> square into four and obtain squares of dimension 2<sup>n</sup> x 2<sup>n</sup> each. Place Turing''s statue anywhere in the one of these squares (marked S in the picture below). Because we’re guaranteed to find a single square empty in each of the four quadrants wherever we want them (that''s the induction hypothesis), let’s put the empty squares in the remaining three squares of each 2<sup>n</sup> x 2<sup>n</sup> square as such:</p>                <div class="img"><img src="./images/articles/statue.png"/></div>                <p>Now the rest is pretty obvious: place an L-shaped tile covering the squares marked X!! And so P(n) implies P(n + 1), and by principle of mathematical induction, the statement is true for all n!! And since we can place Turing''s statue anywhere now, it follows that we can place it at the center. All of us (including Jed) can go home happy!!</p>                <p>So in a way we managed to get to the solution by making our problem harder than it originally was. How did that work? It worked because induction works by assuming that whatever we’re trying to prove is true. The stronger the hypothesis, the more...liberal...our assumption is. In our case, assuming that you can have an empty square <i>anywhere</i> in the 2<sup>n</sup> square turned out to be far more powerful than assuming that you can have a square (specifically) at the centre. We simply exploited this as a tool to get to our solution.</p>                <p>And that’s how you solve problems by making them harder :-)</p>                <p>P. S. Did you notice something else? The proof actually gives an algorithm to find a tiling!! Can you work out the details?</p>                <p></p>                <p><i>Adapted from Mathematics for Computer Science, Leighton et al (2012).

I remember my classmates running around trying to get letters of recommendation as early as at the beginning of the third semester. Although an internship after the third year of BTech is an absolute must for both getting a good job after graduation and for applying for higher studies, an internship after the second year helps boost one’s profile for graduate school applications more than job applications.</p>                <p>There are a lot of internship opportunities available for Computer Science students with the increase in the number of tech companies and research programs at various universities within and outside India. I am going to talk exclusively about research-based internships here, because I know better about them through first-hand experience. CSEA does a really good job at spreading awareness about these through the annual internship talk, but something I found slightly disappointing was that very few people actually apply to these programs to avail of these remarkable opportunities.</p>                <p>In my conversations with fellow classmates and juniors, I found that most of them felt that they were not qualified enough for the internship programs, especially those outside India, and so they did not apply. Through this article, I would like to encourage all the current students to apply to these opportunities. You will never know until you actually apply. It is all about demand and supply. Perhaps you have something they are looking for, but if you do not apply in the first place, you will never get it. It is like a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>                <p>I know this because when I was applying for research internships at universities outside India in my third year, I was very confident that I would not get into any of them. That was mainly because I had heard so much about the IIT bias and also the fact that I had no prior research experience. I felt like it was a vicious cycle: you need research experience to get a research internship and you need the latter for the former too, but as it turned out, this was not the case. I got accepted into a lot of programs, leaving me completely surprised (pleasantly).</p>              </div>              <div class="col-md-6">                <p>I am not saying that you do not need a good profile to get accepted, but I knew people who had good profiles and yet did not apply. I would like to encourage you to not be one such person. If you are still in your first or second year, you have a lot of time to work on your profile. The easiest way is to complete online courses in your area of interest within Computer Science. There are multiple options available now: Coursera, Udacity and edX among others. Completing such courses and doing some project work shows that you are motivated and focused, which is something people look for when they review internship applications.</p>                  <p>But is it really worth the effort to apply to these programs? Filling up long forms and getting the required supporting documents from college is in fact very time-consuming. I think it is totally worth it. Through my internship, I got to learn a lot of new things. It also helped me develop skills in working on my own and as a team. I learned how to look at a problem from different perspectives to come up with novel solutions. These internships also come with a huge benefit of research-related letters of recommendation, which is a big plus for graduate school applications, especially if you are applying for a PhD. This, again, is from my first-hand experience.</p>                  <p>I know that a lot of you reading this article have not even thought about higher studies, but I see it as a way of keeping that door open. It will only add plus points to your profile, and who knows, maybe the internship will motivate you to pursue higher education. Personally, I had never thought of doing a PhD, but during my internship, I enjoyed research so much that I started applying for graduate school programs as soon as I came back.</p>                  <p>All in all, I hope I was successful in somewhat demystifying research-based internships and encouraging you to at least consider applying. I found the website www.internshala.com very helpful in finding information about these programs and I urge you to visit it. Good luck!</p>              </div>            </div>          </div>        </div>      </div>    </div>  </div>'),

It refers to ‘light’ based communication technology that delivers a high-speed, bidirectional networked, mobile communications in a similar manner as Wifi.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>                 \r\nThe idea is very simple. Wifi uses radio frequencies to transmit data which lies in the electromagnetic spectrum. Visible light also belongs to this same electromagnetic spectrum and has higher frequencies than radio frequency. If communication can be made possible by using this higher frequency wave spectrum, more data can be transferred in a cheaper rate. Moreover since light is one of the most prominent radiation that we observe in our daily life, lesser effort will have to be made for its deployment. Developing on this idea, pureLifi is bringing the technology to the real world. The tests are still going on and the technology is not ready to be used prime-time, but the future is bright. \r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p class="title">How Lifi works?</p>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\nLifi uses visible light as a means of transmitting data. In an LED light bulb, when a constant current is applied, a stream of photons are emitted and these are what we observe as visible light. If current is varied, the light intensity changes. Since LED light bulbs are semiconductor devices, the output from it can be modulated at extremely high speeds, undetected by human eyes but easily detectable by a photo-detector device, which can then convert it back to electrical current.Thus communication becomes possible with the help of visible light.        \r\n                </p><br>\r\n              </div>\r\n              <div class="col-md-6">\r\n                \r\n                <p class="title">A few features of Lifi</p>\r\n                <ul class="newul">\r\n                        <li>\r\nBandwidth - Visible light spectrum is unused and free to use.\r\n                        </li>\r\n                        <li>\r\nLow cost - Requires fewer components than required to set up Wifi\r\n                        </li>\r\n                        <li>\r\nHigh Speed - Very high speed data rates can be obtained due to low interference, high device bandwidths and high intensity optical output\r\n                        </li>\r\n                        <li>\r\nSafe - Life on earth has evolved through exposure to visible light and there are no known safety or health hazards against visible light\r\n                        </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n                </div>            \r\n            </div>          \r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>'),

This article will give you a very high level idea of all career paths possible for you to take up, after a Bachelors degree in CS. The article will also provide a very brief description of the competencies and skills required when you opt for each of these career paths.\r\n                </p><br>\r\n                <p class="title"> Software Development, SW Test / QA Engg, Support Engg. etc: </p>\r\n                <p>\r\nThis is the most common and the immediate career path which a Computer Science Graduate can opt for. The nature of work varies from one company to another and also depends on the job profile. For Software Engineering profiles, you need to be a good programmer. Apart from just programming from scratch, you may also be spending time on adding new features over the existing code base, gathering requirements from clients, designing the software architecture etc. Some companies, especially the big ones will have a lot of quality enforcement on the software pieces they develop, as each element will have many issues involving customers in case of presence of any bugs. As your experience increases in the Software engineering profiles, you may move shift towards the design / architecture of software systems. In some companies, you may get specialized programming tasks like Network programming, Linux Kernel module development etc. Before applying for a company, it is strongly recommended that you to catch up with someone at the company working in the same profile and try to understand how the nature of work will be.\r\n\r\n                </p><br>\r\n                <p class="title">What about joining a Startup?</p>\r\n                <p>\r\nYes, of course it is a good idea, but there are few things which you need to be very careful about. The problem with big companies is that the work may get narrowed down over some part of a big software and the contribution of an individual to the work may be very less. While working in some other companies, it can even end up in having very less time for coding, and more time on other activities like collecting the requirements, preparing documents etc. In Start-Ups, generally, you may get really good quality work, but sometimes you may end up working over time. You need to check the following factors before going for a startup:<br><br>\r\n●     What are they working on? Can you see a really good scope for this in future as well?<br><br>\r\n●     Who started it? Is it being run by someone who is really into innovation?\r\n                </p><br>\r\n                <p class="title">Specialized Computer Science Jobs / Research & Development:</p>\r\n                <p>\r\nSpecialized Computer Science careers means job profiles like: Machine Learning Scientist, Compiler Engineering, Kernel Engineer etc, and also various Research and Development jobs in core Computer Science domains or in interdisciplinary branches like Computational Neuroscience, Quantum Computing, BioInformatics etc. These kind of jobs are well suited for those who are really passionate about some particular domain in Computer Science and those who want to make some really impactful innovations. Most of these profiles require you to have at least a masters in the relevant subjects to get into them. Sometimes after gaining relevant experience in the Software Industry, one may be able to switch to specialized jobs. For example you can move as a Kernel Developer after having working in some domains of Linux Systems / Kernel module development. If  the difference between the general Software Engineering jobs and these specialized profiles is prodded upon, an example can be cited: In big companies, Machine Learning Scientists / R&D teams develops the algorithms / models for machine learning and the Software Engineers uses the libraries developed by them to implement Machine Learning in various systems. If you are planning to take up this path, then it is strongly recommended not to stop your studies with just an undergraduate degree. At least before the end of your third year try to figure out the areas you would like to focus further. Also make sure to explore various domains(especially inter disciplinary) and see if they suit your interest. Try to do your final year project in the area which you try to focus in the future.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p class="title">Higher Studies in Computer Science:</p>\r\n<p>\r\nUnless you are planning to continue in Software Engineering job profiles, it is strongly recommended to go for education beyond graduation. There are post graduate courses by various universities which can help you enhance your career in Software Engineering. Specialization in a particular domain improves your chance of working in more core technologies.\r\n </p>\r\n              </div>\r\n              <div class="col-md-6">                \r\n<p class="title">Higher Studies in Computer Science:</p>\r\n<p>\r\nUnless you are planning to continue in Software Engineering job profiles, it is strongly recommended to go for education beyond graduation. There are post graduate courses by various universities which can help you enhance your career in Software Engineering. Specialization in a particular domain improves your chance of working in more core technologies.\r\n </p>\r\n \r\n<p class="title">Higher Studies Abroad:</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMost of the foreign universities are taking a considerable number of students from India and you will definitely have a really high chance of getting in easily. If you are planning for higher studies, these are the things that are recommended to plan during your studies:<br>\r\n●     Do a really good final year project on the domain you would like to specialize in future. Also, try to do some other projects outside curriculum in the related domains.<br>\r\n●     Maintain a good CGPA.<br>\r\n●     Try to publish a paper. This really enhances your chance of getting into a top college.<br>\r\n●     Try to do a summer research internship in the area you would like to study further.<br><br>\r\nAfter working for few years in some company you can still plan for your further studies and if the work in the company is in a relevant technology which you would like to specialize, it really improves your chance of getting into a good university. There is also an option to opt for PhD directly after graduation. For this you need to be more focused on the domain during your studies and should have proper projects with research elements, as it is a little harder compared to getting into masters programme.\r\n </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="title">Careers in Academics + Research:</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIf you have an interest in sharing knowledge with others and shaping the future generations, then you should go for this holy profession. Nowadays, especially in foreign universities, a career as an Academician is not merely teaching. The faculties will be scientists and they will be continuously working on their researches. Various companies fund for the projects / researches. This will be a good profession if you want to keep learning always in your life and continually research on areas you like.\r\n </p>\r\n \r\n<p class="title">Management Careers:</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIf you interest is not towards Computer Science / Programming and if it is towards managing or coordinating projects / processes, then there is always an option to opt for management jobs. There are various options in the management side like: Finance Management, Human Resource Management, Production Management, Business Analysis etc. Preferably you need to pursue an MBA (or some other post graduate degree in business) to get into management profiles. You can also get into after these profiles after having enough work experience. You can also move to Software Development Management profiles and for that you should have some experience as a Software Engineer.\r\n</p> \r\n\r\n<p class="title">Making a Start Up:</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIf you have some really innovative idea in your mind, at some point in your life, then you should think about making a startup. Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and all the big companies now were some small startups at some point of time, which were started by people like you. Before starting a firm think properly what innovation it is going to make in the society, how it is going to generate revenue in future etc. Now there is a lot of support from government and other private organizations for startups. If you are not confident enough to implement it immediately, then you can join some startup / companies for few years and by then you may learn more strategies on running a firm yourself.\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<p class="title">General advice while in college:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n●     Practice programing properly and be really good in at least one programming language. Programming is always required whichever career path you choose in Computer Science.<br>\r\n●     Never learn anything just for grades. Approach subjects with a passion. Learn properly, even outside the curriculum, at least one domain. Try to code and implement yourself the features in the area which you are interested in. For example, if you are interested in Cryptography, try to implement all the Crypto Algorithms yourself and evaluate it.<br>\r\n●     Take your major project seriously. Try to make some innovation out of it and publish a paper. Also try to do other projects yourself.<br>\r\n●     Make sure to enjoy your college life. This is the best part of your life and make it always memorable. Enjoy the Calicut city, try out all the varieties of food, for which Calicut city is famous. Be a part of Tathva, Ragam and other activities in college. <br>\r\n              </p><br>\r\n              </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div><!--containerfluid-->\r\n\r\n        </div><!--light div-->\r\n      </div><!--scroller-->\r\n    </div><!--content -->\r\n  </div><!--bb-item-->'),

Further, he went on to pursue a PhD degree from Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore and was awarded the same in 1999. His primary research interests center around Programming Languages and Compilers. He has held several prestigious positions, serving as the Head of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (July 2008 - July 2010) and has also been a Member of the Board of Governors, NIT Calicut (March 2013 - March 2015).

The good teacher explains. The superior teacher demonstrates. The great teacher inspires.\r\n                                </blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n                                <p>Well, there is one such teacher who has been an inspiration to the many batches of students that our department has produced. The teacher we have all looked up to. The teacher whom we have feared at some point or the other. The teacher who taught us the importance of being brief and precise. And probably the only teacher in our department who even has a fan club on Facebook to his honor. We have seen the way he handles his classes with utmost sincerity and dedication, the uniqueness that sets him apart so much that most students attend his classes right from day one to his very last class in a semester, regardless of attendance that most students crave for. So when we got an opportunity to interview him for Threads, our department newsletter, we were indeed elated. On the day of the interview when we stood outside CSE 201C, frankly we were a bit scared too, apart from being thoroughly excited. And forty minutes later, when the interview got over we realized that we would cherish the very experience every time we would look back at our college life.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                                <p>So here is the complete interview for you all to enjoy:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                                <p><b>Team:</b> What is about teaching that you find most enjoyable and also most challenging?</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                                <p><b>Paleri sir:</b> It was incidental that I came to the teaching profession. After completing my Bachelors degree, I had told my friends that the one thing I won''t be doing is coming back to teach. But it was purely a coincidence. After around four years of passing out from here, I came back as a teacher. From that point onwards, I''ll say that, I haven''t regretted it. Rather, I have enjoyed it. And I feel that it is really a challenge for any teacher to convey whatever he wants to, identifying what exactly has to be conveyed, not whatever is there in a textbook. But as a teacher, we have to identify what to convey and that does take a long time and then conveying the things so that the students understand it, by making it simple: this is not an easy job. And it is only after 10-15 years of teaching the same subject that I am able to convey it a simple manner. Initially, I just studied whatever was in the textbook, using standard textbooks of course and delivered it. But now, I use the reference textbooks, now I decide what needs to be conveyed, what needn’t be conveyed and I choose my own examples, simplified if possible which comes through experience.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                                <p><b>Team:</b> What is that you like the most about the field of CS and personally having done your Bachelors in EE, how was the transition for you and what propelled you to do so?</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                                <p><b>Paleri sir:</b> When I passed out from here with a basic degree in Electrical Engineering, there was an elective subject in my seventh semester which was basically CS or Computer Engineering which dealt with the digital fundamentals and somehow I was interested in that subject. I wanted to take a Masters at an IIT, that is in the field of digital systems at some IIT. Then I went to IIT Kanpur, before which I joined here for a Masters programme which I quit after 2 months. Then I went to IITK for a Masters programme in Digital Systems, I wrote the entrance test and passed it. I failed in the interview and I didn’t get an admission there. I still remember how they asked some fundamental questions in EE namely superposition theorem etc. and I made some mistakes. Then I thought, if I make some mistakes in the fundamentals, I don''t deserve any good universities. So I gracefully accepted that. Luckily there was a programme called Computer Trainee at the computer centre at IITK and I applied and I got through. After one year, there was another colleague of mine in that programme, a B. Tech (Chemical Engineering) from IITK. One day he asked me, shall we write GATE in CS (first ever GATE in the field of CSE). I asked him if he was joking and I also added that coming from a EE background it is not an easy job. Then he said, we will write in CS. He was of the opinion that there are only very few institutes that offer B. Tech. in CS. He advised that we needn''t compete with IITians, instead only NITians. Finally, I found that he was talking logic. We took the syllabus, prepared and wrote GATE. Out of the 108 people who wrote, I came 40th and he came 41st. We both didn’t get admission anywhere based on the score we got. Next year I got admission at IIT Kanpur and he at IIT Bombay based on the interview conducted by these IITs.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                                <p><b>Team:</b> Who is the one person who has had the most powerful impact on you, your research and your career?</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                                <p><b>Paleri sir:</b> As far as academics is concerned, it is Prof. Dijkstra who has influenced me profoundly. In the sense that I don’t find an article of that calibre written by anybody else even after 40 years. I don''t find the kind of articles he has written and influence on me regarding all those things as far the discipline of CS is concerned. Wherever I go, I ask students what their discipline is, is it Computing Science or Computer Science, it all came by clarity from Dijkstra.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                                <p><b>Team:</b> What is it that motivated you to come back to your Alma Mater as faculty?</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                                <p><b>Paleri sir:</b> It was not my desire, again a coincidence. After my M. Tech in IIT Kanpur, I thought of only public sector jobs, I didn’t want to go for private sector companies. So I was trying for a couple of companies like CMC but couldn’t get through. Finally, I landed in TCIL (Telecommunications Consultants India Limited) in Delhi. I was supposed to join and they asked for two testimonials. By mistake, I assumed that they had asked only one. But then when I went to submit the documents, they said I needed to submit two testimonials. So I said I''d join with those two testimonials after a few days. My cousin was with me then, we came back to his house and there was a letter waiting for me from my classmate from NITC, Suresh Manimala. He came for an Alumni meet here and meet the Principal at that time, Prof. Unnikrishna Pillai. Coming back for your previous question as to who influenced me, Academics it is Dijkstra and in Administration, I haven’t seen a person like Prof. Pillai. I wasn’t sure at all by now and I was uncomfortable thinking of what I would tell TCIL. I asked for a month’s extension to join. Then, I came here, met Prof. Pillai. He said with my qualification, I could make it easily but then I told him that I needed time to decide. Finally, I took the decision to come here and met Prof. Pillai again. He immediately contacted Prof. M. N. Neelakantan, the HOD of Computer Engineering, the registrar and conducted the interview. Then I was offered the job on a temporary basis and then I came aboard.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                                <p><b>Team:</b> What is your most favourite course to teach and what is the best research project you enjoyed working on? <b></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                                <p><b>Paleri sir:</b> As far as teaching is concerned, you know that my area is Compilers and with Dijkstra''s influence, programming was at the background all the time. But Compilers was my core area. Because of Dijkstra''s influences, you can see that there is a FOP course which has undergone a lot of changes over the time. FOP is one such course that you won''t find in many places in India and it is indeed a very important course. As far as research is concerned, I went to St. Petersburg, Russia under the USSR Govt. Doctoral Scholarship.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                                <p>I was introduced to formal models of concurrent computing that time, then I came back without completing the programme and landed in IISc, Bangalore for my Ph.D. I still remember, by about a year or so, the problem was clear and I had to go deeper and deeper for the solution, which was basically a simple algorithm for partial redundancy elimination which I consider the best algorithm till date. People haven''t agreed fully but they have accepted it. Since then, we have been working on code optimization but I still remember this particular algorithm.</p>\r\n                                \r\n                                <p><b>Team:</b> How different would you term your teaching experiences here and abroad?</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                                <p><b>Paleri sir:</b> So to sum up, this was what I felt in my office at Purdue and that was, there is a lot of time to teach here, unlike in NIT Calicut, back then when there was a lot of other work.

A good teacher will never tell that some particular topic is difficult. If a teacher says so, it essentially means that he is not fully clear about something about that topic.

This is because they shouldn''t face dejection as far as career is concerned. For example, a real computer programmer should be a developer and not a tester which is merely a technician role.

However, the notion of a function does not define the algorithm to get from the input to the output. This means that using this definition of functions, you have the freedom to define your own functions, provided you can specify the domain and range precisely. So a function which outputs the number of sand grains in the Sahara desert at a particular instant of time is perfectly legal! This however does not ensure that there exists an algorithm to do it.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                                <p>Such functions that are definable by an algorithm are called computable functions. There also exists functions which can be proved to not have an algorithm and they are called non-computable functions. One such function known as the Busy Beaver function was defined by Timos Rado in his 1961 paper "On Non-Computable Functions".</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                                <p>The busy beaver function is concerned with a model of executing algorithms known as Turing machines. A Turing machine is a machine which has an infinite bidirectional input/output tape, a tape head and rules governing the movement of the tape head on the tape. The tape is divided into cells and the symbols written on the tape are from an alphabet \\(\\Sigma\\).Similar to a finite state machine, a Turing machine has a set of states, \\(Q\\) and a transition function \\(\\delta\\). The tape head reads one symbol on the tape at a time and based on the transition function, overwrites the symbol with another symbol and shifts (steps either right or left on the tape<sup>1</sup>. The Turing machine also has a halt state whereby the machine stops running. The running time of a Turing machine on an input is measured as the number of shifts it performs before it enters its halting configuration. A binary Turing machine is one with \\(\\Sigma = \\{0 , 1\\}\\).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                                <p>Not all Turing machines stop running on its given input. The problem of determining whether a Turing machine \\(M\\) halts on input \\(x\\) is known as the halting problem. The halting problem has been shown to be undecidable, meaning that there is no Turing machine (or algorithm for that matter) to solve it. We could try simulating a given machine, to see if it stops after a while. But the problem is that we don''t know for how long the simulation should continue. Suppose we simulate a Turing machine \\(M\\) on input \\(x\\) using another Turing machine<sup>2</sup> for \\(t\\) steps and conclude that it does not halt, we can always find another Turing machine \\(M''\\) which halts on input \\(x\\) in \\(t + 1\\) steps. Hence simulation does not work.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                                <p>Turns out that the Turing machine model can simulate circuits (both sequential and combinational) and hence we can safely conclude that it is capable of simulating all algorithms that can be run on a real computer.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                                <p>We call a binary Turing Machine a \\(k\\)-state Busy Beaver if on an empty tape as input it halts and runs for at least as many steps as any other \\(k\\)-state binary Turing machine.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                                <p>In order to find a \\(k\\)-state Busy Beaver, we would have to evaluate all \\(k\\)-state binary Turing machines. How many such Turing machines exist?</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                                <p style="font-size:90%;"><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;The Turing machine which we define here does not have a center shift, meaning that the tape head must move left or right after each move.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                                <p style="font-size:90%;"><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;called the Universal Turing Machine or UTM</p>\r\n                            </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n                            <div class="col-md-6">\r\n                                <p>Since we have fixed the cardinality of Q and the alphabet (\\(\\Sigma = \\{0, 1\\}\\)), the number of possible Turing machines is equal to the number of possible transition functions.

Hence our assumption must be wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                                <p style="font-family:courier;"><b>function</b> HALTS?

This is because if some computable function \\(f\\) grew faster than the Busy Beaver function, the function call to BB in the above algorithm can be replaced with a call to this function \\(f\\), enabling us to solve the halting problem. Again our assumption would be wrong.

The Busy Beaver series suggests a new method for solving theoretical problems in mathematics. For example, suppose we have a Turing machine \\(M\\) which verifies Goldbach''s conjecture(which states that every even number \\(n\\), \\(n &gt; = 4\\) is the sum of two primes) and it has \\(k\\) states. If we were able to find \\(BB(k)\\) exactly then we could run \\(M\\) for \\(BB(k)\\) steps and conclude that the conjecture holds if it does not stop within that many steps, else we conclude that the conjecture does not hold.</p>\r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>'),

For someone aspiring to reach the top, say the CEO of Google or so, would a degree from NITC be a bit of a let down (it is not an IIT, hence no similar levels of exposure and opportunity, which cumulates\r\n																	up. You don’t get a good research internship / good recommendation =&gt; no good university for MS =&gt; not a nice position for a job to start with, etc)?</p>\r\n															</blockquote>\r\n															<p>and</p>\r\n															<blockquote>\r\n																<p>What are the benefits of Open Source contribution experience in Industry? I know that competitive programming helps one in making data structures and algorithms concepts stronger, but open source development also teaches one how to read\r\n																	and maintain large code bases, which is an important skill in the industry. Then why, in the placement procedure and many other activities, is competitive programming given much more importance over Open Source contribution?</p>\r\n															</blockquote>\r\n														</li>\r\n														<li>\r\n															<p>There was just one question about the age old debate on the importance of GPA.</p>\r\n														</li>\r\n														<li>\r\n															<p>I was happy to see that NITC has not lost its sense of humor as one of the questions was: <q>Will you marry me?</q></p>\r\n														</li>\r\n													</ol>\r\n													<p>I am not an authority on any of these questions (perhaps except the last one (-:) and am still trying to figure out answers to most of these myself.

After being away from a traditional educational institution, it took me a whole semester to figure out how to learn effectively. How come my usual learning process, reliable enough to pass\r\n																any exam in college, was not working anymore? If I knew about <em><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn">the science of learning</a></em> back in college, I would not have taken any pride in not\r\n																taking effective notes in classes or studying only a night before an exam.

In college, I had figured out how to juggle my life around my various roles (student, with CSEA, remote internship, lab administration, projects, TEDx, competitions), especially thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blaK_tB_KQA">Randy Pausch’s advice</a>.\r\n																But I failed to do enough justice to some of them while being a perfectionist at others. I wish I then knew the meaning of <q>doing things right vs. doing the right things.</q></p>\r\n														</dd>\r\n													</dl>\r\n												</div>\r\n												<div class="col-md-6">\r\n													<dl>\r\n														<dt><a id="Importance_of_Reading_41"></a>Importance of Reading</dt>\r\n														<dd>\r\n															<p>If I were to list out each successful (for some criteria of success) person I have ever met, I doubt I will find any who said they were not a voracious reader. Be it books (fiction, non-fiction, other various genres) or technical literature\r\n																(textbooks, research papers, source code, technical blogs, etc), reading always stands out as a common factor in the people I come to admire. It took me first two years of college to realize I was not reading enough, which led me to take\r\n																up <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/3890-2016-reading-challenge">yearly reading challenges</a>. It took me another four years to be comfortable <a href="http://techglider.in/quote/2010/12/25/this-is-the-last-lecture-i-am-giving-you/">reading technical literature</a>.\r\n																I wish I had taken more time in college to learn and practice how to read effectively.\r\n															</p>\r\n														</dd><dt><a id="Importance_of_Writing_45"></a>Importance of Writing</dt>\r\n														<dd>\r\n															<p>Another common factor I find in most successful people is being able to communicate ideas effectively both in written and spoken form (it can be argued that former has more impact and lasting value for a CS professional). I practiced writing\r\n																consistently over my four years of college – either on <a href="http://techglider.in/post/">my blog</a>, lengthy email debates on FOSSCell mailing list, or those memos I wrote for my CSEA team. Having a public blog led to interesting discussions,\r\n																opportunities, and credibility boost. But, I wish I then knew the benefits of writing a private journal to introspect my day and plan ahead the next. It also helps to reflect back both on a short and long-term basis to figure out what\r\n																one wants to do with their life.\r\n															</p>\r\n														</dd><dt><a id="Coding_in_a_HighLevel_Language_49"></a>Coding in a High-Level Language</dt>\r\n														<dd>\r\n															<p>Though I knew some Python in college, I did not get to exercise it much during my time there. This was primarily because most of the curriculum is based on C and I did not work on many hobby projects. Department faculty take the stance\r\n																that teaching programming concepts in C helps students learn how things work at a lower level. Yet, I came to observe that <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~ksinghal/post/java/">this inhibited my ability to think at a higher abstraction level</a>.\r\n																I wish I had spent more time learning either modern C++, Java, (advanced) Python or a functional programming language like Haskell. Knowing just C can severely limit one’s ability to solve problems and perform well in job interviews.</p>\r\n														</dd><dt><a id="How_to_Think_53"></a>How to Think</dt>\r\n														<dd>\r\n															<p>One of the primary goals of a college education is to teach one how to think for themselves. This not only involves using independent thought to work on projects and assignments but also learning to <a href="https://plus.google.com/+KartikSinghal/posts/FMCPbKXgetY">honestly accept your ignorance and ask questions</a>.\r\n																It was easy in college to get involved in groupthink or forget that my only real competition was with my past self. I wish I had taken <a href="http://techglider.in/quote/2011/03/06/i-am-free-no-matter-what-rules-surround/">full responsibility for my own education</a>																and not depended too much on the limitations of my alma mater.</p>\r\n														</dd>\r\n													</dl>\r\n													<p>One thing common to all the above skills and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacognition">meta-skills</a> is that they take consistent practice and effort to develop (I am still continuously learning them). A college environment\r\n														provides a good combination of personal freedom, enough free time, necessary infrastructure, and a conducive learning ecosystem (with classes, teachers, and peers) that, in my opinion, it is just the right time to develop these skills. I\r\n														wish I knew this back then.</p>\r\n													<hr>\r\n													<p>I have deliberately left the questions raised in the survey unanswered in this article.

If I could peer ahead, I would have seen the two paths wind away into the horizon, but alas, I wasn''t blessed with foresight. The Creator had deemed that I be a creature of the moment, tackling my life one line of fate at a time. </p>\r\n<p>I am an alchemist.</p>\r\n<p>My life is consumed by the task of converting ores into precious objects the cores employ to fulfill the tasks enlisted to our workforce. If you were to ask me, and you never will, I’d describe life as a series of remarkable events, just like the rest of humanity would. Some events are tougher on the nerves than others – oh to speak of the terrors I’ve seen! Many a time, I’ve walked the whole way to find that there is nowhere left to go and I stay stuck in limbo! All I can do then is to await divine intervention, for the masters of my fate to offer me yet another exception, a call to the higher powers, for a chance to start my life anew. But between these events though, I merely lie dormant, ruminating on the lessons and exceptions I’ve encountered in the recent past, learning from the endless errors I’ve encountered and fixed. </p>\r\n\r\n              </div>\r\n              <div class="col-md-6">\r\n                <h4></h4>\r\n<p>Each event, no matter how short or long, complex or direct, quick or slow, brings me back to this fundamental battle of choice. Over my past instances, I’ve realized that one road will result in the repetition of the whole event, whilst the other is my way out to the next. The former I see, is worn out and ridden with potholes. I can see bugs crawling all over the edges, fault lines segmenting the oft-trodden road. It hits me with a strong sense of déjà vu; I am overwhelmed by the belief that some version of me, in another time, in another space, has taken this road, battling the demons popping up at every step.</p><p> And yet as I look at the other one, I know, despite my lack of foresight, that it is the way out of the infinite loop of detecting and fixing the errors my masters have created in their ignorance and oversight. No faults, no crawling bugs, no permission violations, no illegal activities await my perusal along this road. Just a quick and uninterrupted traversal to the end of the source, a hassle-free conversion to the final object. </p>\r\n<p>I may end up compiling mile-long strips of ore, using my skill and knowledge to allow my masters to create an object perfect in its execution. But as my life terminates at the end of the long run, as the workforce goes to sleep till the power returns, I shall look back upon this fork in the road. Amidst a deep sigh of 0s and 1s, I shall be telling my children, my threads, that I took the one less travelled by, and that has made all the difference.\r\n</p>\r\n              </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div><!--containerfluid-->\r\n\r\n        </div><!--light div-->\r\n      </div><!--scroller-->\r\n    </div><!--content -->\r\n  </div><!--bb-item-->\r\n'),

Firstly, we have an article written by a 2013 alumnus, Kartik Singhal, that sheds some light on the most popular and frequently asked questions and concerns raised by the CSE body in a poll taken recently. Read on to learn what to expect and what to be prepared for through his first-hand experience in the industry and in pursuing a graduate degree. Secondly, we have an interesting and highly informative article written by none other than the former secretary of CSEA (a 2016 alumnus), K Prasad Krishnan, titled "Big Data: The Hadoop way". </p> \r\n<br/>\r\n<p>Further, through this issue we attempt to pursue a whole new take on the art that is programming. Errors are necessarily evil. Or so we are accustomed to believe anyway. \r\nAs gratifying as it is to see the results of a hundred lines of code toiled over for, one has got to admit that nothing is as frustrating as a missing little semicolon, or a sneaky null reference somewhere in your code. Don''t miss out on the article "The Fork Not Taken", offering a unique perspective on this very predicament. \r\nSo the next time you get stuck with a compile time error, remember - "To err is human; to compile, divine".</p> \r\n<br/>\r\n<p>Until next time.</p> \r\n<br/>\r\n<div align="right"><p>- Team Threads</p></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n        </div><!--light div-->\r\n      </div><!--scroller-->\r\n    </div><!--content --> \r\n  </div><!--bb-item-->\r\n'),

Over the past few years from 2006, Hadoop, the big data technology has been making its presence felt in the industry with the various companies including Facebook, Google and Yahoo adopting it and more and more companies trying to.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                                <p>So, what is this Hadoop anyway? According to Wikipedia, Hadoop is an open-source software framework written in Java for distributed storage and distributed processing of very large data sets on computer clusters built from commodity hardware. Inspite of the presence of Distributed computing since decades, yet Hadoop was able to make a difference in the industry. It is different from the traditional distributed computing technologies and simplified parallel programming greatly. Anyone with enough programming knowledge could now write a simple Map Reduce program in any programming knowledge blissfully unaware that it will be running in parallel in Hadoop.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                                <p>The amount of data generated in the Web today is enormous. The hard disk drives(to store data) have become cheaper but to process the data to the tunes of petabytes and terabytes efficiently is still a challenge. Hadoop comes with an answer with its HDFS, a file system to store data and Map Reduce, its data analysis engine. Hadoop is designed for batch processing or near real time processing(as it is often called) and not for applications requiring real time processing for which traditional RDBMSs would fare better. Even that is changing now as a new project called Apache Spark is promising to have processing speed 10x to 100x times faster than the Map Reduce framework and thus, the number of Spark users is increasing day by day.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                                <p>Hadoop was created by Doug Cutting in 2005. Initially created for a project called Nutch, a search engine, it was when Cutting moved into Yahoo in 2005 that he could work with a dedicated team on Hadoop. Cutting named Hadoop after his son''s toy elephant. In 2008, a 910-node Yahoo cluster sorted one terabyte in 209 seconds with 1000 lines of Java code beating the previous winner by over 1 minute (see <a href="http://sortbenchmark.org">sortbenchmark.org</a>).</p>\r\n                            </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n                            <div class="col-md-6">\r\n                                <p>Hadoop mainly consists of two components, HDFS(Hadoop Distributed File System) to store the huge data sets(in the scale of terabytes and petabytes) and the Map Reduce engine to process the data sets. Hadoop mainly stresses on "scale out" rather than "scale up" i.e use more of commodity hardware rather than increasing the processing power of existing hardware. The Hadoop cluster consists of a NameNode(master) which stores the metadata about the files in the cluster and sevaral DataNodes where the actual data resides, in block size of 64 MB (typically). And it provides a replication factor of 3 (default) meaning, at an instance 3 copies of file exists. It is quite easy to manipulate files in HDFS as various commands(like the common Linux commands we are familiar with) are available.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                                <p>The Map Reduce program consists of two parts- a Mapper and a Reducer. A Mapper maps a set of key-value pairs to another set(possibly different) of key-value pairs. Then, keys are sorted and a key and its corresponding values is fed as input to the Reducer which produces another set of key-value pairs as output. Although initially it would seem difficult to write programs suited to this framework, almost all programs can be worked out to be written in this "MapReduce" way. The Map Reduce engine consists of a central JobTracker (similiar to NameNode in HDFS) to which the client submits the Map Reduce job. It then splits the job to different tasks and assigns it to different TaskTrackers(similiar to DataNodes in HDFS). Although Java is generally used to write MapReduce programs, with a utility called Hadoop Streaming, it is possible to write the mapper and reducer programs in any programming language(even shell scripts).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                                <p>Along with Hadoop there are several different projects built in and around Hadoop like:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                                <ol type="i">\r\n                                    <li>\r\n                                        <a href="https://hive.apache.org/">Hive</a>, a data warehouse infrastructure,\r\n                                    </li>\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    <li>\r\n                                        <a href="http://hbase.apache.org/">HBase</a>, a distributed, versioned, non-relational database,\r\n                                    </li>\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    <li>\r\n                                        <a href="http://oozie.apache.org/">Oozie</a>, a workflow scheduler,\r\n                                    </li>\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    <li>\r\n                                        <a href="https://sqoop.apache.org/docs/1.4.6/SqoopUserGuide.html">Sqoop</a>, a tool for transferring data between relational databases and Hadoop,\r\n                                    </li>\r\n                                </ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n                                <p>etc.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                                <p>Though many fear that Hadoop has already passed its peak, the ever evolving projects in the Hadoop ecosystem is a proof that this technology is here to stay.

Tech CSE Batch of 2017</em></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n					<div class="container-fluid">\r\n						<div class="row">\r\n							<div class="col-md-6">\r\n								<p>There''s this road in my home town Thrissur called Palace Road, the peculiarity of the road being that two clothing behemoths - Kalyan Silks and Pulimootil Silks - have set up their stores right next to each other!! I passionately try to avoid these places because every time I go shopping there with my cousins, they go to one store first, decide there''s not enough selection and go immediately to the other store, and I have no choice but to tag along with them (no offence to the shopping enthusiasts out there).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n								<p>This also doesn''t make sense from an business point of view - why on earth would you go set up a store right under an established competitor''s nose? Wouldn''t it have been more profitable to set it somewhere where there ISN''T such a store available, so that you get more people and hence more profits?</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n								<p>And the surprising fact is that this isn''t exclusive to just clothing stores, there are plenty of other such examples in the real world (this might also be very relatable):</p>\r\n								\r\n								<br>\r\n\r\n								<div class="img"><img src="http://newsletter-cseanitc.rhcloud.com/uploads/photos/34.jpg">\r\n								</div>\r\n								\r\n								<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n								<p>These examples defy logic. Or do they? Let''s have a look.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n								<p>Imagine there''s a beach (there''s no need to imagine anything else) and there are children playing on the beach. You''re an ice-cream seller, and fortunately, you happen to be the first ice-cream seller along that part of the beach. Where would you set up your store? Basically you could''ve set up your store anywhere along the beach, and those who are in dire need of an ice-cream would have come to you anyway because you''re the only ice-cream seller on that beach. But since you''re such a nice guy/gal, you decide to set up shop at the centre of the beach so that the maximum distance that people will have to walk is limited to half a mile:</p>\r\n								\r\n								<br>\r\n\r\n								<div class="img"><img src="http://newsletter-cseanitc.rhcloud.com/uploads/photos/35.jpg">\r\n								</div>\r\n								\r\n								<br>\r\n\r\n								<p>The plan works out well, business is booming, you''re happy, your customers are happy. So far, so good.</p>\r\n								\r\n								<p>But not for long.</p>\r\n\r\n								<p>Enter Ted, your arch-enemy, who also happens to be selling the exact same product as you are!! Not wanting to make a scene, you both decide to occupy different sections of the beach so as to serve different customers. The chosen positions are also optimal in the sense that now the maximum distance a customer has to walk is a quarter mile, and not half a mile as earlier:\r\n								\r\n								<br>\r\n\r\n								<div class="img"><img src="http://newsletter-cseanitc.rhcloud.com/uploads/photos/36.jpg">\r\n								</div>\r\n								\r\n								<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n								<p>Even then, things are going fine. Until your arch-enemy decides to reveal his true self, and sets up shop right at the centre and gains the upper hand:</p>\r\n								\r\n								<br>\r\n\r\n								<div class="img"><img src="http://newsletter-cseanitc.rhcloud.com/uploads/photos/37.jpg">\r\n								</div>\r\n								\r\n								<br>\r\n								\r\n								<p>That jerk!! It''s time for payback. We come up with the following plan - we''ll rise and shine a little earlier than usual the next day and set up shop in such a way that we get 75% of the market share and he''s left with the rest:</p>\r\n								\r\n								<br>\r\n\r\n								<div class="img"><img src="http://newsletter-cseanitc.rhcloud.com/uploads/photos/38.jpg">\r\n								</div>\r\n								\r\n								<br>\r\n								\r\n							</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n							<div class="col-md-6">								\r\n\r\n								<p>The clever reader will already have realized the flaw in our plan: he can set up shop a few paces away from us and coolly recapture his share of the market:</p>\r\n								\r\n								<br>\r\n\r\n								<div class="img"><img src="http://newsletter-cseanitc.rhcloud.com/uploads/photos/39.jpg">\r\n								</div>\r\n								\r\n								<br>\r\n								\r\n								<p>Damn, we underestimated him.</p>\r\n\r\n								<p>But no, we have no intention of losing that easily. At the next opportunity, WE move ten paces from him so as to gain the upper hand:</p>\r\n								\r\n								<br>\r\n\r\n								<div class="img"><img src="http://newsletter-cseanitc.rhcloud.com/uploads/photos/40.jpg">\r\n								</div>\r\n								\r\n								<br>\r\n\r\n								<p>But then, he isn''t to be taken lightly either. He moves his shop a few paces from us at his next opportunity, just like we did. This to-and-to motion continues until both the sellers end up at the exact centre of the beach:</p>\r\n								\r\n								<br>\r\n\r\n								<div class="img"><img src="http://newsletter-cseanitc.rhcloud.com/uploads/photos/41.jpg">\r\n								</div>\r\n								\r\n								<br>\r\n\r\n								<p>And so there you go -- shops eventually get set up close to each other, even if it doesn''t seem to make sense business-wise. This is called <b>Hoteling''s model of spatial simulation</b> in the literature, if you''re into these kinds of things.</p>\r\n								\r\n								<p>There are a few more things worthy of note here. This kind of a situation where nobody has any incentive to shift from his or her strategy is termed in economics and game theory as a Nash equilibrium. (Yep, that''s the same Nash you saw in the famous movie <i>A Beautiful Mind</i>). The movement towards the centre happened because the initial position that we and Ted had set up in was not a Nash equilibrium -- any of us could have tried shifting a little bit towards the centre to gain the upper hand (like Ted did):</p>\r\n								\r\n								<br>\r\n\r\n								<div class="img"><img src="http://newsletter-cseanitc.rhcloud.com/uploads/photos/42.jpg">\r\n								</div>\r\n								\r\n								<br>\r\n\r\n								<p>This is also a classic example of how a Nash equilibrium might not lead to a globally optimal outcome. Notice now that in the worst case, a customer who wants ice-cream will have to walk half a mile as opposed to the quarter mile she only would have had to walk when both the sellers set up shops in their original positions.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n								<p>...and that''s one explanation of why shops of the same kind tend to cluster. Philosophically speaking, I like to think of this as the mathematical explanation behind the time-tested statement "Keep your enemies close" ;-)</p>\r\n								\r\n								<p>Hope you enjoyed this exposure to some aspects of game theory. It''s a fascinating subject, and is full of such examples.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n								<p><i>P. S. Although this is a pretty standard example in economics and game theory, images have been blatantly copied from <a href="http://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-do-competitors-open-their-stores-next-to-one-another-jac-de-haan">here</a>.

The king, however, wanted to give him another chance. The king ordered him to his presence and asked him to choose one of the three knights present.<br>\r\n								<br>\r\n								One of the knights is the Knight of Life, and he always tells the truth. The second Knight is the Knight of Death, and he always tells lies. The third knight is the Knight of the Dungeon.

If he chooses the Knight of the Dungeon, he would spend the rest of his life imprisoned in the Dungeon.<br>\r\n								<br>\r\n								This is the first time the man ever saw these knights and could not recognize them. However, the man is allowed to ask these three knights one question each. Thus, the man asked the red-haired knight, "What is the name of this blond hair knight?" The reply was "He is the Knight of the Life." He asked the black-haired knight, "What is the name of this blond-haired knight?" The reply was "He is the Knight of Death." Then he asked the blond-haired knight "Who are you?" "I am the Knight of the Dungeon" was the reply. Luckily, the man was able to correctly choose the Knight of Life, and was set free immediately.

While we are all guilty of spending sizeable portions of our time daily on the online social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter, the availability of such enormous amounts of data about the activities and interactions among people is allowing research into the social structures by graph theoretic means.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n								<p>In simple words, Social Network Analysis (SNA) is the analysis of networked structure of interactions between actors (most commonly, people) by putting the entities as nodes and the interactions (or ties) between them as edges on a graph. The goal behind all of this is to look for information present in the network properties that are not apparent before visualising them as graphs. Once it is made to a graph, we can estimate various parameters of the network such as degree distribution of the nodes, the average shortest path lengths, the clustering coefficients and community structures; and these parameters help us in characterizing the network.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n								<p>Now, real-world social interactions more often than not have some well-studied properties that hold even across networks from different domains. One such property is that the networks which are mostly sparse and exhibit a Small-world network property which says that even if most nodes are not neighbours of one another, most nodes can be reached from every other node by a very small number of edges. In the early 20th century, a widely popular notion ''Six degrees of separation'' came up that suggested all living people in the world in just six or fewer steps away from each other by a chains of acquaintances. While that essentially rephrased the Small-world property, there was a recent study at Cornell [1] that uses the entire Facebook network of about 721 million active users and 69 billion friendship links and observes the average distance to be just 4.74; the world is indeed smaller than we think it is.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n								<p>SNA can be a prove to be a powerful tool in a variety of applications. One such area of application is in effective information spread in a network or marketing. Suppose you want to announce the launch of your new product to the people such that the information reaches everyone and quickly. If you know about the patterns of interaction among the people, how they interact and their degree of <i>relatedness</i>, you can potentially use that intelligence to pick out the <i>influential</i> people in the network, so that you target them with the information and it cascades fast and well to (most of) the population in minimum hops or time thereby reducing your cost or effort of marketing. A very similar approach is taken in SNAzzy (Social Network Analysis for Telecom Business Intelligence) for analysis of social networks created by "who-calls-whom" calling patterns of customers of Telecom Service Providers. By doing so, several insights about community structures, targets for campaigning of products and relative <i>importance</i> in the network are estimated.</p>\r\n							</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n							<div class="col-md-6">\r\n								<p>Apart from marketing, SNA makes way for a detailed study of organised crimes such as terrorism, drug-trafficking and money laundering. Since it is a given fact that criminals make their group(s) of communication and coordination for their activities, intelligence using SNA tools is of help to track criminals. Interesting to note that, Saddam Hussein’s capture was in fact facilitated by SNA. Then Valdis Krebs manually constructed a terrorist network comprising the 19 hijackers involved in the 9/11 attacks [2]. The network was constructed from information about relationships among the hijackers from publicly released data from major newspapers; from the association matrix to integrate these relations, he drew the network showing possible patterns of association.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n								<p><img alt="The Terrorist Network surrounding 19 hijackers on Sep 11, 2001" src="http://newsletter-cseanitc.rhcloud.com/uploads/photos/49.jpg" style="width:100%">\r\n								</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n								<center>\r\n									<small>The Terrorist Network surrounding 19 hijackers on Sep 11, 2001</small>\r\n								</center>\r\n								<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n								<p>After such visualisation, structural analysis is done on the graph to offer further intelligence about structural motifs and patterns in the network.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n								<p>Since Social Network Analysis originates from social science research as a set of analytical tools that could map the members, their relationships, and patterns of collaboration, the possible application areas of the same is numerous and varied.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n								<p>There goes my two cents of an introduction and motivation to read up further about SNA.</p>\r\n\r\n								<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\n								<p>[1] “Four Degrees of Separation” by Lars Backstrom, Paolo Boldi, Marco Rosa, Johan Ugander, Sebastiano Vigna.

When I pondered on what topic I should write about in the alumnus column of the CSEA newsletter, I was perplexed. I thought about the technologies I have been working on like NoSQL DB, Ruby on Rails or Lambdas in Java which are fun and are trending. But there is one topic that I have come to understand and realize in the last 2 years after college and I think is my responsibility to share, which is something unique that I can talk about or contribute to - Women in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics). This is specially for the young women in our college and all the young men who have women in their life ;-)</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n								<p>Out of the total workforce in STEM, only 14% are women, according to the&nbsp;US Congressional Joint Economic Committee<sup><a href="http://www.esa.doc.gov/sites/default/files/womeninstemagaptoinnovation8311.pdf">[1]</a></sup>. Is it because women generally don’t have the aptitude required for mathematics or calculations? But when I think about it, I have several examples to counter the theory. Did you know that the world’s first programmer is a woman - <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/babbage/adalovelace/">Ada Lovelace</a>? Did you know that <a href="http://physicsgirl.com/">Sabrina Pasterski</a> - who is just 22, has Stephen Hawking citing her papers!? There have been extensive studies in this area and the major attributes that contribute to this phenomenon are lack of exposure to the area in the early days, and even if they had opportunities to explore these areas, being a homemaker becomes the primary responsibility, and without a good support system, women drop out of these areas.&nbsp; There are many possible factors contributing to the discrepancy of women and men in STEM jobs, including: a lack of female role models, gender stereotyping, and less family-friendly flexibility in the STEM fields.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n								<p><b>Where are we headed to?</b>\r\n								</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n								<p>The world has become a global village. With mobile phones and internet becoming a necessary good like food, clothing and shelter, businesses reach a diverse audience. To deliver products and services that appeal to the diverse customer base, employers are giving due importance to diversity in their employee base. After all, putting oneself in the customer’s shoes and developing a product is of utmost importance for global enterprises.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n								<p><i>"If people think alike, then no matter how smart they are they most likely will get stuck at the same locally optimal solutions.

First, we have an article by Aashish Satyajith - "Why Competitors Open Stores Right Next to Each Other", a simple game theoretic concept not many of us might know. Chances are, you may have wondered about the same at some point. It will all make sense after this, trust me.</p>\r\n					<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n					<p>We have another interesting article by Pratik Banerjee about Social Network analysis.

But not everything is worth ‘building’ for the sake of ‘understanding’. As far as I am concerned, if you can tell things apart in situations where others fail, you’re good to go. We’ve all come across terms which appear to be no different from each other. Well, appearances can be deceiving. It’s intriguing and often very interesting to find the subtle differences which accurately define things that ‘appear’ to be same. In this article let’s take on one such pair - Simulators and Emulators.</p>\r\n\r\n              <p> Both the words, simulate and emulate roughly translates to mimicking of some sort. It is the purpose of this mimicking that really separates the two. For those of you who are too excited to find out the differences, fast forward to the end of the article. You will find a list of differences there. For the rest of you, let’s get started! </p>\r\n\r\n              <p>  Simulations are models that can be manipulated logically to represent how a particular system works. It is NOT a substitute for the actual target which is being simulated.  It has some characteristics that match reality and some that don’t. The purpose of simulation is to study the system internally and make useful optimizations before building a full scale project. Consider the example of a flight simulator.  A flight simulator is a device that artificially re-creates aircraft flight experience and the environment in which it flies, for pilot training, design, or other purposes.  Although the look and feel of the system closely resembles an actual flight, it cannot be used as a substitute, well because, it cannot fly! Also, while simulating, the mimicking happens at a ‘conscious’ level, meaning the user is well aware that he/she is working with a model.</p>\r\n\r\n              <p> Emulation is the process of mimicking the outwardly observable behaviour or interface to match an existing target. Emulators provide a black box implementation of the target. Emulators CAN be different from the target internally, but it ‘acts’ like the target to anything that communicates to it.  Emulators can (and most probably will be) used as a substitute for the target to be emulated. The purpose of emulation is not to study the system; it is to study the interactions of other entities with the system. Also here the mimicking happens at an ‘unconscious’ level. This does not mean that the designer is unaware of the mimicking, but the external component that interacts with the system is.</p>\r\n              </div>\r\n              <div class="col-md-6">\r\n                <p> Enough with literature, now let’s talk about software. In software terms simulators are used to study or design other systems or environments. SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Program Emphasis) is an example of simulator software. It is used in integrated circuits and board-level design to check the integrity of circuits before implementing them using hardware. Obviously the simulation we used to analyse the system cannot be used as a substitute to the actual circuitry. A wide variety of simulation software exists to handle anything from chemical kinetics to fluid dynamics. In fact simulation software plays a key role in applying modern computing technologies to various engineering disciplines.</p>\r\n\r\n                <p> Emulators on the other hand, are software designed to run programs which were designed for another platform (or hardware specifications) without changes to the actual program. As mentioned, the emulated platform may not be internally the same as the target. It may use other suitable implementations. What matters is the interface. Note that here the emulation is not used to study the platform but its interaction with the program. Emulators are handy tools for developers building cross platform software to test their software without the hassle of using different hardware for each platform. Also note that here the emulation is actually used as a substitute for the target. VirtualBox is a popular example of emulator software. It enables a Windows or Mac user to run any other OS from inside their own OS. With VirtualBox running a specific OS any programs written for that OS can run inside it. Bluestacks is another popular example. It is an Android emulator that enables Android apps to be run on Windows or Mac.</p>\r\n              <p>To wrap it up let’s summarize the key differences between them.</p>       \r\n              <div class = "img"> <img src="http://newsletter-cseanitc.rhcloud.com/uploads/photos/57.jpg">\r\n              </div>  \r\n\r\n              <p>There you have it, simulation and emulation – two separate modelling techniques. </p>\r\n              </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div><!--containerfluid-->\r\n\r\n        </div><!--light div-->\r\n      </div><!--scroller-->\r\n    </div><!--content -->\r\n  </div><!--bb-item-->\r\n');
